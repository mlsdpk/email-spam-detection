# Email Spam Detection Project

Spam detection is one of the major applications of Machine Learning in the interwebs today. Pretty much all of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built in and automatically classify such mails as 'Junk Mail'.

In this project, we will be using **Naive Bayes algorithm** to create a model that can classify SMS messages as spam or not spam. Being able to identify spam messages is a binary classification problem as messages are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam'. Also, this is a supervised learning problem, as we will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions.
