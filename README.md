# Email Spam Detection Project

Spam detection is one of the major applications of Machine Learning in the interwebs today. Pretty much all of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built in and automatically classify such mails as 'Junk Mail'.

In this project, we will be using **Naive Bayes algorithm** to create a model that can classify SMS messages as spam or not spam. Being able to identify spam messages is a binary classification problem as messages are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam'. Also, this is a supervised learning problem, as we will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions.

## Overview

This project has been broken down in to the following steps:

- Step 0: Introduction to the Naive Bayes Theorem
- Step 1.1: Understanding our dataset
- Step 1.2: Data Preprocessing
- Step 2.1: Bag of Words(BoW)
- Step 2.2: Implementing BoW from scratch
- Step 2.3: Implementing Bag of Words in scikit-learn
- Step 3.1: Training and testing sets
- Step 3.2: Applying Bag of Words processing to our dataset.
- Step 4.1: Bayes Theorem implementation from scratch
- Step 4.2: Naive Bayes implementation from scratch
- Step 5: Naive Bayes implementation using scikit-learn
- Step 6: Evaluating our model
- Step 7: Conclusion

You can find all the step by step implementations in the notebook.
